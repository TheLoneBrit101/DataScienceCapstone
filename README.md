## Coursera Swiftkey Capstone Project

This is the Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone Project sponsored by Swiftkey.

The app uses a 5-gram back-off model with Stupid Backoff to predict the next word in a sentence.

The app is still under construction, however the model can be tested out [here](https://thelonebrit101.shinyapps.io/Capstone/).
